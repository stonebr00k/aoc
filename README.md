# AoC

Here you'll find my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

My solutions are all, so far, written in T-SQL. It's usually far from the best/most performant way to solve the puzzles in AoC, but since it's the language I'm most comfortable with I thought it'd be a fun challange.
