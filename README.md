# AoC

Here you'll find my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

My solutions are all, so far, written in T-SQL. It's usually far from the best/most performant way to solve the puzzles in AoC, but since it's the language I'm most comfortable with I thought it'd be a fun challange.  

I'll also mostly try to write the code so that it'll be able to run inline, even when it's obviously not the most performant solution. This means I'll avoid the use of temp-tables, cursors, while loops and variables (except when parsing the input file and turning it into a SQL friendly format, usually JSON) if at all possible. I just like the challange :).
